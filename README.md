# Local Falcon MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for the [Local Falcon API](https://www.localfalcon.com/), implemented in TypeScript, using the official MCP SDK. This server exposes Local Falcon reporting capabilities as MCP tools, enabling integration with agentic AI systems and workflows.

---

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (install the LTS version)

### Getting Started in Claude Desktop

1. Create a new directory for the MCP server and install the package.
```bash
mkdir lf-mcp
cd lf-mcp 
npm i @local-falcon/mcp
```

2. Copy the path to the installed npm module and add it to the args in the mcp.json file making sure to point to the index.js file under /dist.
3. Add your API key to the env in the mcp.json file.

## Running via STDIO

For MacOS/Unix use the following format:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "local-falcon-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/lf-mcp/node_modules/@local-falcon/mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "LOCALFALCON_API_KEY": "INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Windows use the following format:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "local-falcon-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\lf-mcp\\node_modules\\@local-falcon\\mcp\\dist\\index.js"],
      "env": {
        "LOCALFALCON_API_KEY": "INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Running via SSE via a STDIO Gateway

For all platforms use the following format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "local-falcon-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.localfalcon.com/sse?local_falcon_api_key=INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Pro Users

For Claude Max/Team users you unlock a greater MCP tool call limit. This must be enabled by appending the `is_pro=true` in the query string of the URL. For example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "local-falcon-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.localfalcon.com/sse?local_falcon_api_key=INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&is_pro=true"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Running via Claude Integrations (SSE)

If connecting to Claude integrations:
1. name the server `Local Falcon MCP`
2. add the following url: https://mcp.localfalcon.com/sse?local_falcon_api_key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
